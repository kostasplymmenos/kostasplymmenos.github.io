							<h1 class="mb-4">Kostas Plymmenos</h1>
							<p class="mb-4">I am a professional software engineer and a technology enthusiast. Studied Computer Science and Telecommunications at the University of Athens and currently employed in a startup company to do my backend dev and engineering magic!</p>

							<h1 class="mb-4"><u>My Experience & Education</u></h1>
							<p class="mb-4">The beggining of my career started with me joining the <a href="http://di.uoa.gr">department of Computer Science and Telecommunications at University of Athens</a> in 2015 .<br> The journey was great since I met people passionate as me about the subject and the professors were really helpful giving us a lot of cool projects and assignments.<br> In the meanwhile, I was also developing my personal projects, doing courses on Udemy and Udacity and reading a lot in places like Quora and Medium.<br> I graduated in 2019 and earned my Bachelor's Degree with the specializations of Software Engineering & Data Science having a solid understanding of Computational Theory and Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Programming Languages, Networks, AI & Data Science.</p></p>
							<p class="mb-4">In September 2018 I get an offer from a startup company to work professionally as a software engineer. I couldn't miss the opportunity to work in a fast paced enviroment with amazing culture and a lot of new technologies to learn, so I accept!<br>This turned out to be maybe the best decision I could make since I improve myself, my technical and my soft skills constantly working there with great people on interesting projects</p>
							<p class="mb-4">I started with writing software tests in order to understand the product and continued with some DevOps and small bug fixing. I gained a solid understanding of Software Development Life Cycle and Web Development and now I am a core member of our agile team designing and implementing functionality on our backend systems.</p>	
							<p class="mb-4">More Specifically, we work Agile with the help of Atlassian products, collaborating with remote teams, the business and the data science department of our company. The main tech stack we have been working on is Node.js - MongoDB - Redis for backend, Angular for frontend, Java and Objective-C for our SDKs in Android and iOS respectively. GitLab and GitLab CI for source control and Continuous Integration, Mocha and Selenium for our tests, Docker, nginx and AWS for our servers, Munin and Prometheus for Monitoring. I have also worked with React.js, Apache and PHP for our side products.</p>

							<details>
								<summary>HTTP Server and Web Crawler with a Search engine</summary>
								<p class="mb-4">The project includes: A multithreaded HTTP Server written in C from scratch, using unix system calls and socket library. Implements only the GET HTTP operation.
									<br>
									A web creator script that creates a connected graph of webpages with random links to each other and mock content.
									<br>
									A multithreaded Web Crawler App that searches the connected graph of web pages and downloads them through our own http server.
									<br>
									Each web crawler worker is integrated with a previous project that takes some text files (web pages) and stores their data to it's own trie data structure.
									<br>
									Workers expose telnet ports that a user can connect to and query the data of the downloaded web pages very fast. Data is organised in a trie data structure and a BM25 search engine is implemented</p>

								<summary>MiniJava Compiler</summary>
								<p class="mb-4">MiniJava is a subset of Java programming language.<br> In this course project we got the miniJava language specifications and its parser and made a compiler for that language in Java in order to syntax check, type check and eventually create intermediate LLVM code of the input minjava program.</p>
							</details>
							<br>
							<details>
								<summary>Social Network Web Application</summary>
								<p class="mb-4">In this project we created a social network like LinkedIn where a user could Sign up, create his profile, connect with other people, post, like and comment other posts.<br> He could have a chat with his connections, make a job post or apply to them. <br>Finally, we integrated a modified k-Nearest Neighboor algorithm to suggest posts from non connected with him people.<br>Backend was made withn Node.js Mongo and Express and the frontend was server-side rendered with ejs. We also added SSL to support https communication</p>
