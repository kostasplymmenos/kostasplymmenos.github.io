							<h1 class="mb-4"><u>My Experience & Education</u></h1>
							<p class="mb-4">The beggining of my career started with me joining the department of Computer Science and Telecommunications at University of Athens in 2015.<br> The journey was great since I met people passionate as me about the subject and the professors were really helpful giving us a lot of cool projects and assignments.<br> In the meanwhile, I was also developing my personal projects, doing courses on Udemy and Udacity and reading a lot in places like Quora and Medium.<br> I graduated in 2019 with the specializations of Software Engineering & Data Science having a solid understanding of Computational Theory and Algorithms, Computer Architecture, Programming Languages, Networks, AI & Data Science.</p></p>
							<p class="mb-4">In September 2018 I get an offer from a startup company to work professionally as a software engineer. I couldn't miss the opportunity to work in a fast paced enviroment with amazing culture and a lot of new technologies to learn, so I accept!<br>This turned out to be maybe the best decision I could make since I improve myself, my technical and my soft skills constantly working there with great people on interesting projects</p>
							<p class="mb-4">I started with writing software tests in order to understand the product and continued with some DevOps and small bug fixing. I gained a solid understanding of Software Development Life Cycle and Web Development and now I am a core member of our agile team designing and implementing functionality on our backend systems.</p>	
							<p class="mb-4">More Specifically, we work Agile with the help of Atlassian products, collaborating with remote teams, the business and the data science department of our company. The main tech stack we have been working on is Node.js - MongoDB - Redis for backend, Angular for frontend, Java and Objective-C for our SDKs in Android and iOS respectively. GitLab and GitLab CI for source control and Continuous Integration, Mocha and Selenium for our tests, Docker, nginx and AWS for our servers, Munin and Prometheus for Monitoring. I have also worked with React.js, Apache and PHP for our side products.</p>
